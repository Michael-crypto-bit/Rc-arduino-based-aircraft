a repository of all files needed to recreate my aircraft, only use the most updated ones as some originals were dicarded, and are only here to show the pth I took
items need:
1-2 ESCs and motors around 2200kv which is what i used
arduino Nano
4 micro servos
lipo battery - must match the draw of motors, they will power arduino in turn
controller or diy one this will not show you how to build one
reciever/transmitter any arduino based one should work
a decent amount of trial and error
