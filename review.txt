Such as with the wings which went through almost 8 iteration the design plan was pretty simple, design, reference with partial demo, and if successful print or if not redesign. Especially with the wings time was a big issue 3d printing the wings alone in the v7.1 took almost 5 days, so the later iterations such as the v8 have not been used. the v8 is designed to minimize weight and filament use only being struts connected with dowels and wrapped in heat shrink plastic the v8 wings are light durable and cheap to make, of which time delayed too much. this is the design process which has led to the creation of this plane.
